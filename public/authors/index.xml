      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hello! I&#39;m an engineering manager who has been working on commercial projects since 2010. Along the way I have been very lucky to learn from outstanding people and work with them on exciting projects:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;helps to deliver and design Yandex Data Proc and Manged Database Services at Yandex Cloud&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;helped to scale a platform for gathering and data analysis from social media sites at Origami Logic&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;designed architecture and developed of white label service which establish interoperability with EETS Toll Charges Domains at Kapsch TrafficCom&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;helped to redesign and scale data processing pipeline for biotech start-up &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/outlierbio/ob-pipelines&#34;&gt;(GitHub)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;helped to deliver outdoor and indoor lighting control system&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;helped to deliver access control and visitor management system&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During my career I have been mostly focused on engineering and scaling of distributed data-intensive systems. In the past years I also got more opportunities to apply bits of my university background (economics, modeling, systems engineering, business continuity) to design, improve efficiency and reliability of large scale systems.&lt;/p&gt;
